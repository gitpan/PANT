PANT version 0.06
=================

This is a set of useful functions to facilitate building packages in
an automate build environment. It has facilities to ease commond tasks
and provide a HTML build log of what happened. It has come about
because I found neither ANT or NANT did quite what I needed, and there 
is "more than one way to do it".

This is the first version, it is currently evolving to meet my needs,
but could well take into account other peoples needs.
